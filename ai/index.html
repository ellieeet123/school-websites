                    <h1>Pre-1950s - Original dreams/ideas of AI</h1>
                    <p>For many years, people have always dreamed of creating "thinking machines". Even for centuries before the first computers were created in the 1950s, there were dreaming about, or attempting, to make "intelligence machines". But they didn't really get anywhere. There were things made such as fake chess playing robots, which were actually a box with a person inside of it, playing chess instead. And in 1907 the author of Wizard of Oz dreamed of a robot called the tik-tok, which was essentially a robot (he just called it a machine) which he described as "Extra-Responsive, Thought Creating, Perfect-Talking Mechanical Man That Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live". But, according to Bruce G. Buchanan’s article in AI Magazine, none of these really got anywhere until about seventy years ago, when the first computers started to take shape.

                    <h1>1950 - Alan Turing's Paper</h1>
                    <p>In 1950, a famous British mathematician named Alan Turing published a paper called "<a href="scsee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>". This paper was one of the first real proposals for possible artificial intelligence, and in it, he says “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’” (Turing 1) This question and idea has always been the basis of artificial intelligence, to be able to create a machine capable of human level thought. While Turing wasn’t the original person who came up with this idea, he contributed greatly to its development. His paper explains how a so-called “thinking machine” could work in theory, and also created a way to test their intelligence, in something called an imitation game. In this game, there is a computer, a person, and an interviewer. None of them can see or hear each other, and can only communicate via digital or textual messaging. The interviewer's job is to figure out which is the human, just based on the textual answers that they both respond with when the interviewer asks them both questions. If the computer successfully tricks the interviewer into thinking it is human, then it has passed the imitation game.

                    <h1>1956 - The Logic Theorist</h1>
                    <p>The Logic Theorist was a computer program that was made to create mathematical proofs for different theorems. According to HistoryComputer.com, it was specifically engineered to mimic the problem solving abilities and skills of humans. It was the first example of a computer that could actually "think", and it produced some very significant results for its time. By today's standards it definitely would not be an amazing piece of artificial intelligence, but at the time, it was groundbreaking, and proved that computers were capable of intelligent behavior.

                    <h1>1956-1975 - Years of Success</h1>
                    <p>During this time, computers advanced significantly, and AI did with them as well. Even though the power of computers wasn't anything close to the ones we have today, they were constantly getting better, allowing for larger and more ambitious AI projects. And by 1970, a man named Marvin Minsky claimed that there would be a computer that would have the same intelligence of an average human. But after a while, the general public realized that most computers at the time really just weren't good enough yet, and Minsky was proved wrong. Even despite this, though, this period was one of the most important ones for AI, as many important concepts and algorithms from this period are still in use today.

                    <h1>1980s-2000s</h1>
                    <p>In the 1980s, AI started to become an active field of research again. The main driving factor for this was a boost in funding, including a $400,000,000 investment from the Japanese government. During this decade, the idea of Deep Learning techniques became popular also, which, according to Rockwell Anyoha’s article for Science in the News, allowed computers to effectively learn from past “experiences” that they have had. Computers also started to get substantially better, which allowed for even larger and more ambitious projects to be made. Some substantial AI programs that came out of this era include a chess playing program made by IBM that beat world grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997, and a speech recognition system made by Dragon Systems (also first released in 1997).

                    <h1>Present Day</h1>
                    <p>Today, artificial intelligence has gotten significantly better than any other time period in history. The size, cost, and power improvements of computers has made them much more accessible to anyone, including AI researchers and computer scientists. This has allowed the field of artificial intelligence to excel. Now, AI is being used in many practical ways, such as education, weather, biology, and medicine. Medicine is arguably the most useful application of AI today. It can be used to learn and detect patterns of symptoms, leading to more accurate diagnosis, handle vast amounts of data and efficiently create interesting and useful stats from it, and even create new medicines. It has also had many successful applications in making our society more sustainable. One recent example was an enzyme developed by artificial intelligence that was able to fully break down plastic. According to Forbes.com, it could break down the plastics in a matter of hours, whereas in the normal environment it would take decades or centuries.
